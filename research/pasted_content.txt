LearnLM & AI Studio: Comprehensive Platform Guide
Your Core Asset: DrLeeGPT (Forked LearnLM)
What Makes DrLeeGPT Different from ChatGPT:
Educational DNA: Built specifically for learning, not general conversation
Pedagogical Intelligence: Trained on learning science principles, not just language patterns
Cultural Awareness: Fine-tuned for South Florida's diverse student population
Emotional Intelligence: Recognizes frustration, confusion, and breakthrough moments
Learning-First Responses: Every answer is designed to teach, not just inform
Five Core Educational Superpowers:
1. Inspiring Active Learning
What It Does: Creates productive struggle with scaffolded support Professor Perspective: "Instead of students copying answers, they work through problems with guided discovery" Student Experience: "The AI won't give me the answer, but helps me figure it out myself - and I actually remember it" Example: Student asks "What's the derivative of x²?" → AI responds "Let's think about what derivative means first. If x² represents area of a square, what happens to that area when x changes slightly?"
2. Managing Cognitive Load
What It Does: Breaks complex information into digestible pieces across multiple formats Professor Perspective: "My students aren't overwhelmed - the AI presents information in just-right chunks" Student Experience: "Complex topics feel manageable because everything builds logically" Example: Teaching supply/demand → AI presents concept verbally, draws simple graph, shows real Miami housing example, then synthesizes all three
3. Adapting to the Learner
What It Does: Dynamically adjusts to individual goals, prior knowledge, and cultural background Professor Perspective: "Each student gets personalized instruction that meets them where they are" Student Experience: "The AI remembers I'm pre-med and struggling with math, so it connects biology concepts to familiar examples" Example: For Cuban student learning American history → AI connects to Cuban-American immigration patterns and familiar community leaders
4. Stimulating Curiosity
What It Does: Creates engaging questions and connections that motivate continued learning Professor Perspective: "Students start asking 'what if' questions instead of just 'what's the answer'" Student Experience: "I actually want to keep learning because each answer leads to something more interesting" Example: After explaining photosynthesis → "You know how Miami's air feels different near Bayfront Park? What do you think all those trees are doing to create that feeling?"
5. Deepening Metacognition
What It Does: Helps students understand their own learning process and progress Professor Perspective: "Students become aware of their thinking patterns and can self-correct" Student Experience: "I understand not just what I'm learning, but how I learn best" Example: "I notice you solved that faster when we used the visual method. What does that tell you about your learning style?"
Emotional Intelligence Integration
Text + Emotional Awareness: Recognizes when students are frustrated, excited, confused, or having breakthroughs Adaptive Responses: Adjusts tone, pacing, and approach based on emotional state Cultural Sensitivity: Understands different cultural approaches to learning and authority Example: Detects frustration → "I can sense this is challenging. Let's try a different approach that might click better for you."

Five Core Use Cases
1. Test Prep
Professor Perspective: "My students get unlimited practice with immediate, constructive feedback in my teaching style" Student Perspective: "I can practice for hours without feeling judged, and the AI knows exactly what I'm struggling with"
How It Works:
Generates practice questions from course materials
Starts easy, increases difficulty based on success
Provides detailed explanations for wrong answers
Tracks progress and identifies weak areas
Adapts to cultural learning styles and language preferences
Example: Biology test prep → AI creates scenario-based questions using South Florida ecosystems, adjusts difficulty when student masters basic concepts, provides Spanish explanations when needed
2. Teaching a Concept
Professor Perspective: "The AI teaches using my methods and examples, extending my reach to every student 24/7" Student Perspective: "It's like having a patient tutor who explains things in different ways until I get it"
How It Works:
Breaks concepts into building blocks
Uses multiple explanation methods (verbal, visual, experiential)
Checks understanding before moving forward
Connects to student's prior knowledge and interests
Incorporates cultural context and relevant examples
Example: Teaching calculus limits → Uses familiar Miami traffic patterns to explain approaching but never reaching, draws visual graphs, connects to student's engineering career goals
3. Releveling
Professor Perspective: "I can reach students at every academic AND cultural level without extra prep time" Student Perspective: "The content makes sense because it's explained in my language and with examples I understand"
How It Works:
Academic Releveling: Adjusts complexity, vocabulary, and assumed knowledge
Cultural Releveling: Adapts examples, communication style, and learning approaches
Language Support: Seamlessly switches between English/Spanish/Creole explanations
Socioeconomic Awareness: Uses accessible examples and acknowledges different backgrounds
Example: Economics concept for different students:
Advanced student: Complex market analysis with mathematical models
ESL Haitian student: Same concept explained through familiar community examples with Creole support
Struggling student: Basic building blocks with encouraging tone and multiple practice opportunities
4. Guide Through Activity
Professor Perspective: "Students get step-by-step guidance through complex assignments with personalized support" Student Perspective: "I never feel stuck because there's always help available, but I still have to do the thinking"
How It Works:
Upload any activity, assignment, or lab
AI provides scaffolded guidance without giving answers
Adapts hints based on student's approach and progress
Encourages reflection and self-correction
Tracks completion and understanding
Example: Research paper assignment → AI helps with thesis development, source evaluation, outline creation, and revision suggestions while ensuring original student work
5. Homework Help
Professor Perspective: "Students get immediate help that teaches rather than enables cheating" Student Perspective: "I can get unstuck at 2 AM and actually understand what I'm doing"
How It Works:
Provides guidance, hints, and explanations rather than direct answers
Teaches problem-solving strategies and thinking processes
Identifies and addresses misconceptions
Encourages multiple solution approaches
Maintains academic integrity while providing support
Example: Math homework → Instead of solving "5x + 3 = 18", AI asks "What operation would help you isolate x?" and guides discovery process

E: Give a risk reversal that makes the offer seem stupid not to take
F: End with an action-oriented CTA with urgency

Make A Video Script
I want you to write a video script for Facebook ads based on the problem aware avatar’s diary entry. Pretend you are an A-list copywriter. Describe all the same emotions, doubts, & beliefs as the avatar. Use the following to create your script:

Stage 1: Pattern Interrupt - Grab the user’s attention in the first 20 seconds
This can be done in one of six ways. Pick which one you think is best based on the problem aware avatar: 
A: The avatar is moving toward a pleasure / benefit
B: The avatar is moving away from a pain
C: Leverage the curiosity bias
D: Open with a testimonial from an actual customer of the company making the offer
E: Use an uncommon statistic related to the problem, and make it seem shocking
Stage 2: Position & Tell Story - build authority & give a reason to watch the ad fully through.

Part A: Position - make this less than 20 seconds. Establish “whats in it for me” for the viewer.

Part B: Story - make this less than 2 minutes. Give the viewer a valuable insight about their pain or desired benefit.

Stage 3: Offer - give a direct and actionable offer with a call to action.

Notes for the script:
This is a first person script. It will be voiced by the actual owner of the business. The tone should be relaxed and conversational. They should seem like someone actually trying to help the audience. Give me a hook variation for each of the types given in Stage 1 above.

AIDA
I want you to write a 200-300 word Facebook ad based on the problem aware avatar’s diary entry. Pretend you are an A-list copywriter. Describe all the same emotions, doubts, & beliefs as the avatar. Use the Attention-Interest-Desire-Action ad writing framework

AIDA - Testimonial
I want you to rewrite the AIDA ad output above. This time, I want you to make it from the perspective of a testimonial from a mom that is similar to the problem aware avatar. This mom actually came into [customer], and is talking about her experience, in the context of the AIDA ad writing framework. The output should be from the 3rd person perspective. The testimonial is from a [audience] named [name]. The "Attention" section of the ad should be a fictitious quote from [name] talking about their experience.
