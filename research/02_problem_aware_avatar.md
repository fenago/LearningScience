## C → Why Are They:

**Main Personality Traits:**
Dr. Chen is analytical, empathetic, and innovation-oriented. She's driven to excel both as a researcher and educator, often working long hours to maintain high standards in both areas. She's adaptable and open to new approaches, particularly those supported by evidence. She values efficiency but not at the expense of quality.

## D → Smart Market Questions

**What keeps them awake at night, eyes open, staring at the ceiling:**
The seemingly impossible task of providing meaningful feedback to hundreds of students while maintaining research productivity and being present for her daughter. She worries about students falling through the cracks in her large classes and questions whether her assessments truly measure learning or just completion. She's concerned that she's not keeping up with the latest teaching innovations that could help her students succeed.

**What are they secretly afraid of in life:**
That she's shortchanging both her students and her daughter because she simply doesn't have enough time to give everyone the attention they deserve. She fears that despite her best efforts, she's becoming the kind of professor who prioritizes research over teaching because the institutional incentives push her in that direction.

**What are they angry about, and who are they angry at:**
She's frustrated with her university for increasing class sizes without proportional support, expecting faculty to maintain research productivity while teaching more students. She's also irritated by the learning management system that's supposed to make her job easier but often creates additional work with its limitations and frequent updates.

**Top 3 frustrations they feel every day:**
1. The overwhelming volume of student emails asking questions that are already answered in the syllabus or course materials
2. The time-consuming process of grading assignments for large classes, which delays feedback and reduces its effectiveness
3. The challenge of personalizing learning for diverse students with varying backgrounds, preparation levels, and learning needs

**Biggest secret desire in life:**
To find a way to be fully present and effective in all her roles—professor, researcher, and mother—without constantly feeling like she's failing at one or more of them. She dreams of teaching in a way that transforms students' understanding while still having time for her research passion and family life.

**Built-in bias to how they make decisions:**
Dr. Chen tends to favor solutions that have empirical support or are recommended by trusted colleagues. She's willing to experiment with new approaches but wants evidence that they'll be worth the investment of her limited time. She's particularly drawn to efficiency-enhancing tools but is skeptical of one-size-fits-all solutions.

**Common words or language unique to them:**
"Let's look at what the research shows..."
"How can we operationalize this concept?"
"What's the evidence for this approach?"
"I'm interested in the practical applications..."
"Let's consider multiple perspectives on this issue..."
"How can we make this more accessible to all students?"

**Top 3 complaints about existing solutions:**
1. Teaching assistants are helpful but inconsistent in quality and require significant training and oversight
2. Current educational technology often creates more administrative work rather than reducing it
3. Existing assessment tools don't adequately measure deeper learning or provide meaningful feedback at scale

## E → Going Deep

**Top 3 Dominant Negative Emotions:**
1. Overwhelm from juggling teaching, research, service, and parenting responsibilities
2. Guilt about not providing enough individualized attention to students or enough time to her daughter
3. Frustration with institutional constraints and inadequate support systems

**Top 3 Dominant Positive Emotions From Solving This Problem:**
1. Relief from having a reliable system to handle routine teaching tasks
2. Satisfaction from being able to focus on higher-level teaching activities that require human expertise
3. Joy from reclaiming time for both meaningful work and personal life

**Top 3 Beliefs They Hold About The World:**
1. Education should be transformative, not just transactional
2. Technology should enhance human capabilities, not replace human connection
3. Work-life balance is essential for sustainable excellence in any field

**Biggest Lifestyle Desire:**
To have a predictable schedule that allows for deep work, quality teaching, and present parenting, without constantly feeling behind or overwhelmed. She wants to enjoy her work again rather than just surviving it.

## F → Purchasing Habits

**Top 3 Decision Triggers:**
1. Evidence that a solution will save significant time without compromising educational quality
2. Recommendations from respected colleagues who face similar challenges
3. Ability to implement gradually without disrupting current courses

**Prior Purchases For This Pain:**
1. Premium subscriptions to productivity tools and academic resources
2. Paid for additional teaching assistant hours from her research funds
3. Invested in time-management coaching and workshops

**Price Tolerance For Offer:**
Moderate to high if it demonstrably addresses her pain points. Willing to spend $1,000-2,000 annually from personal funds if necessary, but would prefer institutional support. Would advocate strongly for departmental or university funding for truly effective solutions.

**Time Horizon Of Solution:**
Expects to invest time upfront to learn and implement a new system, with the expectation of significant time savings within one semester. Values solutions that can scale with her teaching load and adapt to different course types.

## G → Primary Wants

**Wants to be:**
An innovative educator who uses evidence-based methods to maximize student learning while maintaining research productivity and personal well-being.

Provide more personalized feedback, design more authentic assessments, engage more deeply with motivated students, and spend more quality time with her daughter.
