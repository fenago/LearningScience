## Dear Diary: The Overwhelmed Professor

**Tuesday, May 24, 2025**

It's 11:42 PM. I should be sleeping. My alarm will go off in 6 hours and 18 minutes. Instead, I'm sitting at my kitchen table, surrounded by stacks of ungraded papers, my laptop open to 17 browser tabs, and a cold cup of tea I made three hours ago but forgot to drink.

Lily's school project is due tomorrow. She reminded me this morning, her voice small but edged with that familiar disappointment. "Mom, you said you'd help me with the solar system model tonight." I promised her we would. I *promised*. And now she's asleep, and the half-finished planets are scattered across the dining room table, mixed in with my students' midterm essays. Jupiter is missing its Great Red Spot. Earth doesn't have its continents yet. And I have 47 more papers to grade before tomorrow's class.

My eyes burn. That familiar tightness is spreading across my shoulders and up my neck. The headache is coming—the one that starts at the base of my skull and wraps around like a vise. I should take something for it now, before it gets worse. But I can't stop yet.

The kitchen clock ticks. Mocking me. Each second is another moment I'm falling behind.

I pick up the next paper. Alicia's work. She's brilliant but struggling in my research methods class. I can see she's trying to grasp the concepts, but there are fundamental misunderstandings in her experimental design. She needs detailed feedback, a conversation really, not just red marks and a grade. But there are 49 other students in that class. If I spend 15 minutes on each paper—which isn't nearly enough—that's still over 12 hours of grading. For just *one* assignment. For just *one* class.

My phone buzzes. Another email. A student asking a question that's clearly answered in the syllabus. I feel that flash of irritation, then the guilt that follows it. They're just trying to learn. It's not their fault the university keeps increasing class sizes without increasing support. It's not their fault I'm drowning.

I should answer it tomorrow, but I know what will happen. Tomorrow will bring 30 more emails, student office hours, a department meeting, and my research lab to supervise. The email will get buried, the student will feel ignored, and I'll add it to the mountain of small failures accumulating in my mind.

I take a sip of the cold tea and grimace. My reflection in the dark window looks ghostly. When did those dark circles under my eyes become permanent? When did I start looking so... defeated?

This isn't what I imagined when I dreamed of being a professor. I wanted to ignite minds, to guide students through the fascinating world of cognitive psychology, to conduct research that matters. Instead, I'm a paper-grading, email-answering machine who occasionally gets to teach.

Last week, in my intro psych lecture, I saw that moment—that beautiful moment when a concept clicks for a student. Tomas, in the third row, his eyes widening as he finally understood how memory consolidation works. I asked a follow-up question, and he answered with such enthusiasm that it spread to the students around him. For fifteen minutes, the class was electric with genuine learning.

And then I had to move on. Syllabus to cover. Learning objectives to meet. No time to nurture that spark, to see where their curiosity might lead.

I rub my eyes and look at the clock again. Midnight. I should sleep. But if I sleep now, when will these papers get graded? When will I prepare for tomorrow's lecture? When will I finish the revisions on my manuscript that the journal editor is waiting for?

When will I help Lily finish her solar system?

My chest tightens. That familiar pressure of unshed tears. I won't cry. I don't have time to cry.

I think about Mark's email from yesterday. My ex-husband, reminding me that he'll take Lily this weekend, adding "You should rest. You look exhausted." Even during our seven-minute interaction at pickup, my exhaustion was the most notable thing about me.

Is this sustainable? The question haunts me. Can I keep doing this, year after year? Something has to give. But what? My research? I need publications for promotion. My teaching quality? My students deserve better. My time with Lily? Unthinkable.

I pick up my phone and open the Canvas app. Sixty-three notifications. I close it without reading any. I open my email. Eighty-nine unread messages. I close that too.

Instead, I open my browser and type: "how to provide feedback to large classes efficiently." The search returns millions of results. Articles about rubrics and peer grading and technology solutions. I've tried most of them. The rubrics help but still take time to apply thoughtfully. Peer grading requires so much setup and training that it often creates more work than it saves. And the technology solutions I've tried have been clunky, unintuitive, and ultimately more frustrating than helpful.

There has to be a better way. Other professors manage this. Some of my colleagues even seem to have lives outside of work. What am I missing?

I look at the stack of papers again. Then at Lily's half-finished solar system. Then at my laptop with its research data waiting to be analyzed.

I can't do it all. Not well. Not at once. Not alone.

The realization sits heavy in my stomach. I've been trying to be superhuman, and I'm failing. Failing my students, failing my research goals, failing my daughter. Failing myself.

I close my laptop. The papers will have to wait until morning. I'll get up at 5 AM instead of 6. I'll grade before Lily wakes up.

I gather the planets and craft supplies and put them in a box to finish tomorrow evening. I'll cancel my department committee meeting if I have to. Lily's project—and Lily—comes first.

As I turn off the kitchen light, I feel that familiar mix of emotions: guilt for what's left undone, anxiety about tomorrow's too-full schedule, frustration with a system that seems designed to burn out even the most dedicated educators.

But underneath it all, there's something else. A quiet determination. This can't go on. I need to find a solution. Not just better time management or another productivity hack. Something fundamental needs to change.

I just don't know what that is yet.

Tomorrow, after class, I'll talk to Elena in the Education department. She mentioned something about new approaches to assessment at last month's faculty lunch. Maybe she has ideas I haven't considered.

For now, though, I need sleep. Six hours if I'm lucky. It won't be enough, but it rarely is.

Good night, diary. Thanks for listening when I don't have time to call a friend. When I don't have time to see a therapist. When I don't have time for anything but work and Lily and the bare minimum of self-care to keep functioning.

Something has to change. I just hope I figure out what before I break completely.
