## Stage of Awareness: Unaware

## D → Smart Market Questions

**What keeps them awake at night, eyes open, staring at the ceiling:**
The growing disconnect between his traditional teaching methods and the learning preferences of today's students. He worries that his courses are becoming less relevant or engaging despite his deep subject knowledge. He's also concerned about the increasing administrative demands that take time away from research and course preparation.

**What are they secretly afraid of in life:**
Becoming obsolete or irrelevant in an increasingly digital academic environment. He fears that his expertise and teaching style, which have been developed over decades, may no longer be valued in a world that seems to prioritize technological innovation over traditional scholarship.

**What are they angry about, and who are they angry at:**
He's frustrated with university administration for constantly pushing new educational technologies and assessment methods without providing adequate training or evidence of effectiveness. He's also irritated by what he perceives as declining student effort and attention spans, which he attributes partly to smartphone use and social media.

**Top 3 frustrations they feel every day:**
1. The increasing amount of time spent on administrative tasks and grading, leaving less time for meaningful teaching and research
2. Students who are distracted, unprepared, or expect instant feedback at all hours
3. The pressure to incorporate technology into his courses without clear pedagogical benefits

**Biggest secret desire in life:**
To be remembered as a transformative educator who shaped the thinking of generations of students, while also having more time to pursue his own research interests and writing projects.

**Built-in bias to how they make decisions:**
Dr. Harrington tends to favor traditional, proven approaches over innovation for its own sake. He values peer recommendations and empirical evidence when considering changes to his teaching methods. He's skeptical of technological "solutions" that promise to revolutionize education, having seen many come and go throughout his career.

**Common words or language unique to them:**
"Let's examine the historical context..."
"What's the evidence for that assertion?"
"Consider the counterfactual..."
"Let's unpack that idea..."
"In my experience..."
"The historical record suggests..."

**Top 3 complaints about existing solutions:**
1. Educational technology that's complicated to learn and use, with interfaces that aren't intuitive
2. Digital tools that create more work rather than reducing his administrative burden
3. Solutions that seem designed to replace rather than enhance the professor-student relationship

## E → Going Deep

**Top 3 Dominant Negative Emotions:**
1. Anxiety about keeping up with changing student expectations and university demands
2. Frustration with the increasing administrative burden of teaching
3. Nostalgia for a time when students seemed more engaged with deep reading and discussion

**Top 3 Dominant Positive Emotions From Solving This Problem:**
1. Relief from administrative burdens (though he doesn't yet recognize AI could provide this)
2. Satisfaction from more meaningful student interactions
3. Pride in maintaining academic rigor while adapting to modern educational needs

**Top 3 Beliefs They Hold About The World:**
1. Quality education requires human connection and mentorship
2. Understanding history is essential for informed citizenship
3. Critical thinking skills are more important than technological proficiency

**Biggest Lifestyle Desire:**
To achieve a better work-life balance that allows him to focus on the aspects of teaching he loves (mentoring students, leading discussions, research) while reducing the time spent on grading, answering repetitive questions, and administrative tasks.

## F → Purchasing Habits

**Top 3 Decision Triggers:**
1. Recommendations from respected colleagues who have similar teaching philosophies
2. Clear evidence that a solution will save time without compromising educational quality

**Prior Purchases For This Pain:**
1. Hired teaching assistants when department budget allows
2. Purchased premium subscriptions to digital research databases
3. Invested in a high-quality laptop and home office setup for more efficient work

**Price Tolerance For Offer:**
Moderate to high if institutional funding is available. Personally willing to spend $500-1,000 annually for tools that demonstrably improve his teaching efficiency or effectiveness. Would advocate for departmental or university-wide licenses for truly valuable tools.

**Time Horizon Of Solution:**
Expects a learning curve of one semester to implement new tools, with measurable benefits within one academic year. Values solutions that can be adopted incrementally rather than requiring an immediate overhaul of his teaching methods.

## G → Primary Wants

**Wants to gain:**
More meaningful teaching time with students, deeper student engagement with course material, and recognition as an effective educator who maintains high standards.

**Wants to be:**
Respected by colleagues and students as both a scholar and teacher who balances tradition with appropriate innovation.

**Wants to do:**
Focus more on developing critical thinking skills in students and less on administrative tasks; publish more research; mentor promising students more effectively.

**Wants to save:**
Time spent on repetitive grading and answering basic questions; energy wasted on technological troubleshooting; effort spent on administrative paperwork.

**Wants to avoid:**
Being perceived as outdated or resistant to change; compromising academic standards for the sake of convenience; losing the human connection in education.

## H → Empathy Map

**Seeing:**
Colleagues struggling with similar workload issues; students increasingly distracted by devices in class; university administrators promoting various technological solutions without adequate support; younger faculty members seemingly adapting more easily to digital teaching tools.

**Thinking:**
"There must be a better way to balance all these demands without sacrificing quality."
"How can I maintain academic rigor while meeting students where they are?"
"Will all these new technologies actually improve education or just add more complexity?"
"I wish I could clone myself to handle all the administrative tasks and grading."

**Hearing:**
Administrators talking about "innovation" and "digital transformation" in education; colleagues complaining about workload and student engagement; students requesting more immediate feedback and flexible learning options; family members suggesting he should delegate more or work less.

**Feeling:**
Overwhelmed by competing demands on his time; concerned about maintaining relevance; proud of his subject expertise but uncertain about how to best deliver it to today's students; resistant to technological solutions that seem to threaten the human element of teaching.

**Saying:**
"I've been teaching this way successfully for years."
"Technology should serve pedagogy, not the other way around."
"Students need to develop patience and deep thinking skills, not just get quick answers."
"I wish I had more time to focus on what really matters in education."

**Doing:**
Working long hours to maintain course quality; reluctantly adopting minimal required technology; seeking advice from trusted colleagues about teaching challenges; reading articles about educational trends but implementing changes slowly and cautiously; prioritizing in-person office hours and class discussions over digital interactions.
