# LearningScience.ai Project Documentation

This package contains all the research, customer avatars, and landing page specifications for the LearningScience.ai platform. The files are numbered in sequence to indicate the order in which they should be processed.

## File Structure and Purpose

### Research and Customer Avatars
1. `01_unaware_avatar.md` - Detailed customer avatar for a college professor at the Unaware stage of market awareness
2. `02_problem_aware_avatar.md` - Detailed customer avatar for a college professor at the Problem Aware stage
3. `03_solution_aware_avatar.md` - Detailed customer avatar for a college professor at the Solution Aware stage
4. `04_product_aware_avatar.md` - Detailed customer avatar for a college professor at the Product Aware stage
5. `05_most_aware_avatar.md` - Detailed customer avatar for a college professor at the Most Aware stage

### Emotional Context
6. `06_dear_diary_entry.md` - A visceral, emotional diary entry written from the perspective of the Problem Aware avatar (Dr. Sophia Chen), highlighting her dominant negative emotions and daily challenges

### Landing Page Documentation
7. `07_landing_page_specification.md` - Comprehensive, section-by-section specifications for the LearningScience.ai landing page, including:
   - Brand identity (colors, typography, imagery)
   - Detailed specifications for each section (layout, elements, copy)
   - Responsive design guidelines
   - Animation and interaction specifications
   - Conversion rate optimization elements
   - Implementation notes for Windsurf

## How to Use This Documentation

### For Windsurf Implementation
1. Begin by reviewing the customer avatars (files 01-05) to understand the target audience at different awareness stages
2. Read the diary entry (file 06) to gain emotional context for the Problem Aware persona
3. Use the landing page specification (file 07) as your primary implementation guide for Windsurf
4. Follow the section-by-section structure in file 07, which is already aligned with the Magic UI Startup template

### For LLM-Driven Template Completion
1. Process the files in numerical order (01 through 07)
2. Use the outputs from each file as context for processing the next file
3. The landing page specification (file 07) contains all necessary details for template completion, including:
   - Exact copy for each section
   - Color specifications in both hex and RGB formats
   - Detailed layout instructions for desktop, tablet, and mobile
   - Animation and interaction guidelines

## Key Implementation Notes

1. The landing page is specifically designed for college professors at different stages of awareness regarding AI teaching assistants
2. The content addresses key pain points identified in the research: overwhelming workload, scaling quality education, and delayed feedback loops
3. The primary value propositions are: saving time, improving student outcomes, and maintaining academic quality
4. The design emphasizes trust, professionalism, and evidence-based approaches to appeal to the academic audience
5. All copy is provided in the landing page specification and can be used directly or as a strong foundation for further refinement
