"Five Core Educational Superpowers That Transform Teaching & Learning"

Introduction:
"Our platform is built on five fundamental capabilities that transform how professors teach and students learn, all backed by learning science research and fine-tuned for real classroom challenges."

Tab 1: "Inspiring Active Learning"
Description: "Creates productive struggle with scaffolded support that guides students to discover answers themselves rather than simply providing them."
Professor Perspective: "Instead of students copying answers, they work through problems with guided discovery."
Student Experience: "The AI won't give me the answer, but helps me figure it out myself - and I actually remember it because I discovered it."

Tab 2: "Managing Cognitive Load"
Description: "Breaks complex information into digestible pieces across multiple formats, preventing overwhelm and enhancing comprehension."
Professor Perspective: "My students aren't overwhelmed anymore. When teaching supply/demand, the platform presents the concept verbally, draws simple graphs, shows real examples, then synthesizes all three."
Student Experience: "Complex topics feel manageable because everything builds logically from what I already know."

Tab 3: "Adapting to the Learner"
Description: "Dynamically adjusts to individual goals, prior knowledge, and cultural background for truly personalized learning."
Professor Perspective: "Each student gets personalized instruction that meets them where they are."
Student Experience: "The platform remembers I'm pre-med and struggling with math, so it connects concepts to medical examples I understand."

Tab 4: "Stimulating Curiosity"
Description: "Creates engaging questions and connections that motivate continued learning beyond the required material."
Professor Perspective: "Students start asking 'what if' questions instead of just 'what's the answer.'"
Student Experience: "I actually want to keep learning because each answer leads to something more interesting I never thought about."

Tab 5: "Deepening Metacognition"
Description: "Helps students understand their own learning process and progress, developing critical self-awareness."
Professor Perspective: "Students become aware of their thinking patterns and can self-correct."
Student Experience: "I understand not just what I'm learning, but how I learn best."
