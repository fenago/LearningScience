That despite his success, he's not reaching all students effectively. He fears that some students leave his courses without truly understanding economic concepts or developing critical thinking skills. He's also concerned about maintaining his reputation for innovation as new technologies and teaching methods emerge.

**What are they angry about, and who are they angry at:**
He's frustrated with the slow pace of institutional change in higher education and the continued emphasis on research over teaching in many promotion decisions. He's also irritated by educational technology that promises transformation but delivers complications, particularly solutions that don't integrate well with existing systems or require excessive maintenance.
