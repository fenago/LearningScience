## D → Smart Market Questions

**What keeps them awake at night, eyes open, staring at the ceiling:**
How to provide personalized learning experiences in large classes while maintaining research productivity and departmental leadership responsibilities. She worries about students who struggle silently and don't seek help until it's too late. She's concerned about keeping up with rapid advances in both biology and educational technology.

**What are they secretly afraid of in life:**
That despite her best efforts to innovate in teaching, she's not reaching all students effectively. She fears that some students leave her courses without truly understanding core biological concepts. She's also concerned about maintaining relevance as both her field and educational methods evolve rapidly.

**What are they angry about, and who are they angry at:**
She's frustrated with educational technology vendors who make grand promises but deliver products that don't integrate well with existing systems or require excessive setup time. She's also irritated by institutional barriers to teaching innovation and the continued emphasis on research productivity over teaching excellence in promotion decisions.

**Top 3 frustrations they feel every day:**
1. The challenge of providing timely, personalized feedback to large numbers of students
2. The time spent answering repetitive questions that could be addressed through better resources
3. The difficulty of assessing conceptual understanding rather than just factual recall in large classes

**Biggest secret desire in life:**
To transform biology education at scale, making it more engaging, inclusive, and effective, while still maintaining her research program and having time for family and personal interests.

**Built-in bias to how they make decisions:**
Dr. Jackson tends to favor solutions with empirical evidence of effectiveness, particularly in STEM education. She's influenced by recommendations from trusted colleagues who have similar teaching philosophies. She's willing to invest time in solutions that promise significant long-term benefits but is skeptical of quick fixes.

**Common words or language unique to them:**
"Let's look at the evidence..."
"How does this impact student learning outcomes?"
"What's the mechanism behind this approach?"
"I'm interested in the scalability of this solution..."
"How does this support diverse learners?"
"What's the implementation timeline and learning curve?"
