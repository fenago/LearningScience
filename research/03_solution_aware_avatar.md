## D → Smart Market Questions

**What keeps them awake at night, eyes open, staring at the ceiling:**
How to provide timely, personalized feedback on programming assignments for dozens of students when each submission requires careful review. He worries about students developing bad coding habits due to delayed or insufficient feedback. He's also concerned about keeping his curriculum current with rapidly evolving industry practices while maintaining academic rigor.

**What are they secretly afraid of in life:**
That despite his best efforts, he's not preparing students adequately for the rapidly changing tech industry. He fears that his teaching methods, while solid, may not be innovative enough to keep pace with technological advancements. He's also concerned about burnout from the constant pressure to update course materials, grade assignments, and stay current in his field.

**What are they angry about, and who are they angry at:**
He's frustrated with educational technology that promises to streamline teaching but often creates more work or doesn't integrate well with existing systems. He's also irritated by institutional barriers to innovation and the slow pace of curriculum reform despite the rapid evolution of the tech industry.

**Top 3 frustrations they feel every day:**
1. The time-consuming process of providing detailed feedback on programming assignments, often seeing the same mistakes repeatedly
2. Balancing the need to cover fundamental concepts with introducing students to emerging technologies
3. Managing the logistics of group projects and ensuring equitable participation and assessment

**Biggest secret desire in life:**
To develop a teaching approach that scales effectively while still providing personalized learning experiences, allowing him to impact more students without sacrificing his research interests or family time.

**Built-in bias to how they make decisions:**
Dr. Williams tends to favor solutions that have been validated through data or peer experiences. He's willing to experiment with new approaches but wants evidence of effectiveness. He's particularly interested in solutions that have been developed with input from educators rather than purely commercial products.

**Common words or language unique to them:**
"Let's test this hypothesis..."
"What's the algorithmic complexity of this approach?"
"How does this scale?"
"Let's consider the edge cases..."
"What's the evidence that this works?"
"How can we make this more accessible to all students?"

**Top 3 complaints about existing solutions:**
1. Automated grading systems that can't provide nuanced feedback on code quality or approach
2. Learning management systems that are cumbersome for managing programming assignments and code reviews
3. Educational technology that doesn't integrate well with industry-standard development tools
